telco_customer_churn
==============================

# What is the Problem?

## Informal

Predict customer churn.

## Formal

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

- E - Each customer's attributes and whether they churned or not
- T - Classify if a customer will churn
- P - Maximize accuracy

## Assumptions
